# Running `brew bundle` with this file will invoke each line as a brew command.
#
# Running `brew leaves` will show installed formulae that are not dependencies
# of another installed formula. To generate a base Brewfile run:
#
# 	`brew tap | sed 's/^/tap /' > Brewfile`
# 	`brew leaves | sed 's/^/install /' > Brewfile`
